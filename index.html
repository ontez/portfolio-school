                    i will do this by continuing to get good grades to go into a good university to, hopefully, get a goob job. 
                    furthermore, i will work on personal projects along the way to fill in the gaps in knowledge that is implicit in formal schooling.

                    In this program, I calculated the trajectory of a projectile at an inputted velocity and angle. 
                    After looping through the calculation until it hits the ground, it stores each position of the projectile in an array.
                    then, the program loops through the array and draws the trajectory. If the user hits it, the program tells them that they won!

                    In this program, the user inputs a phrase that is split into words and then characters. I am proud of this assignment because of
                    how small and concise the code is. After splitting the phrases and characters, they are stored in an array which is then looped through
                    and printed to the user.

                    In this program, the user can select different mathematical operations and input values to calculate the output. Furthermore, 
                    the output is a string that is different depending on what kind of operation was used. I am proud of this assignment because I think 
                    that it taught me how to effectively use string concantentation.
